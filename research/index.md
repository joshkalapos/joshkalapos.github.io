Computing UV parameterization is a fundamental task in geometry processing with applications in texturing, machine learning and 3D fabrication. In general, the goal is to take a surface and map it to a plane while minimizing the distortion. A recent approach that drastically reduces distortion in parameterization uses the method of cone singularities. Rather than mapping the surface directly to a plane, we can find an intermediate polyhedron that better approximates the surface. Afterwards, the polyhedron can be laid out in the plane by cutting through a spanning tree that passes through the taken cones. However, this pipeline does not guarantee a layout that does not overlap itself. Tackling this problem of layout does not need to take distortion into account, since the shapes have already been flattened. We explore ways to partition the layout so that it is free of overlaps and the separated components are few and semantically reasonable.
