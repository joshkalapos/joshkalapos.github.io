I was born in Toledo, OH but grew up in Pittsburgh, PA. There I graduated from
Mt. Lebanon High School. Following high school, I went to Carnegie Mellon
University's School of Computer Science where I received my bachelor's degree in
Computer Science. Currently, I live in the Boston area and I work for Amazon Robotics.

# Activities

## Cross Country and Track

At CMU I ran for the [cross country
team](http://athletics.cmu.edu/sports/mxc/index) in the fall and the [track and
field team](http://athletics.cmu.edu/sports/mtrack/index) in the winter/spring.
Running was easily one of my biggest time commitments at home or school and has
really shaped my life over the years. Since 2019 (And as of 2020), I am the
[university record
holder](http://athletics.cmu.edu/sports/mtrack/2018-19/releases/20190223xptauj)
of the indoor 5000. 

In the past, My team and I used this really old site
[Logarun](http://www.logarun.com/calendars/joshkalapos/) to track our training.
More currently, I now also use
[Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/40109316) since it automatically gets
uploaded by my watch.

The biggest event in my recent running career is that I broke my ankle back in
November 2019. Three surgeries later in November, December and January has left
me only recently starting to build my mileage back up.

## Star Wars Stuco Instructor

As part of the [Student College program](https://www.cmu.edu/stuco/) at CMU I
cotaught the course Star Wars: The Course Awakens for other students at the
university.

I had taken the course my freshman fall and inherited it a year later when the
former instructors graduated. Since then, my friends and I have taught this
course to classes averaging around 15 students for every semester from Spring
18 to Spring 2020. The curriculum is primarily studying the inspirations that
led to the creation of Star Wars and then also the effects that it has had on
culture following each movie release.
