I was born in Toledo, OH but grew up in Pittsburgh, PA.
There I graduated from Mt. Lebanon High School.

## Activities

# Cross Country and Track

At school I also run for the
[cross country team](http://athletics.cmu.edu/sports/mxc/index)
in the fall and the
[track and field team](http://athletics.cmu.edu/sports/mtrack/index)
in the winter/spring. Every day of the week almost year round I am training
to become a faster competitor.


# Star Wars Stuco Instructor

As part of the [Student College program](https://www.cmu.edu/stuco/) at CMU I
coteach the course Star Wars: The Course Awakens for other students at the
university.

I had taken the course my freshman fall and inherited it a year later
when the former instructors graduated. Since then, my friends and I have taught this
course to classes averaging around 15 students for the Spring 18, Fall 18 and
now the Spring 19 semesters. The curriculum is primarily studying the
inspirations that led to the creation of Star Wars and then also the effects
that it has had on culture following each movie release
