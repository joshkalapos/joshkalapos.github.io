## A first experience of Introduction to Robotics

I haven't built anything more mechanically complex than a Lego
Star Destroyer and all of the robotics classes that I've taken so far
have been very much focused on theory or programming rather than the 
construction of robots. That's probably why this lab was assigned, so
that computer scientists like myself can get familiar with physically
building some system. The whole construction took a couple evenings over
the course of less than a week so I felt that this classified itself 
more as a post than a project.  

There were some requirements on this Rube Goldberg machine, such that
it should occupy a 48x30 *in* space and must stand less than 60 *in* tall.
Additionally, the goal of this machine was to move a golfball from
one point to another, but it could enter anywhere within a one square
foot region in a corner of the machine, and could exit anywhere along the
12 *in* length on the other side. The purpose for this being that all the
groups' rube goldberg machines can be connected to become one giant machine.
Additionally, there had to be at least four "energy transfers," meaning
the motion of some moving object triggers/transfers energy
to another object which will progress the machine. Then, in addition to
these four energy transfers, there must be a launch, so that the ball
reaches a height of at least 62 *in*. This being a slight challenge because
the maximum height of the machine must be less than 60 *in*. 

Here's a video that shows some runs of the machine. We built it almost
entirely out of cardboard and duct tape, with some extra necessary
items such as string, dominos and a mousetrap.
