<center><b>Abstract</b></center>

In this project we revisit Scene Completion with a Million Photographs, a paper written by James Hays and Alexei Efros. The purpose was to take images that have missing/unwanted regions and replace these regions with new, convincing visual data. To complete these images, we rely on finding semantically matching images and then combining them with our original photo the best we can along optimized cuts. With our new implementation, we recreate scenes from the original paper, and possibly some new scenes as well.

# Project Paper

Details about this project can be found in the short paper that I had to write. You can pull it up [here](/assets/img/scenecompletion/scenecompletion.pdf).
