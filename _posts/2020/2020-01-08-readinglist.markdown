This year for 2020 I hope to continue reading and documenting which books 
that I complete here on this website. Though I also found it convenient
to use [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/104759146) to keep track of books as well. 

### The Path to War: How the First World War Created Modern America

Another book for the World War I class. Rather than being an account of the war and its 
battles, this class is more about the cultural shifts that happened to the involved countries. For example, the US going from a neutral power to sending millions overseas to fight on the
Western Front. Or additionally, how the countries had to change their industries to be able
to field such massive armies. 

### Rites of Spring: The Great War and the Birth of the Modern Age

One of the books I will be reading while studying World War I for a class. From the syllabus, this book is read interchangably with a couple others in a rotation, and I will not reach its
conclusion until the end of the semester. 

### Cosmos (January 7th - )

I made a lot of progress on this book the first two days I read it. Then I got poisioned by
a Costco hot dog and lost my reading rhythm. School's back so this book might be a while
coming.  

### All the Shah's Men (January 5th - January 6th)

Picked this book up after the United States military killed Iranian 
general Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike. Writing about this subject
online is a hot take that I won't take a risk for. Old opinions tend
to resurface at inconvenient times. 

### Blueprint: The Evolutionary Origins of a Good Society (October 16th - January 3rd)

I actually started this book deep in 2019 but did not finish it until
winter break in 2020. For a better review, you can probably read the
one [Bill Gates](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Blueprint) wrote. This
book takes an evolutionary approach to how humans have evolved to be
cooperative and social.
