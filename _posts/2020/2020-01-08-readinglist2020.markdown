This year for 2020 I hope to continue reading and documenting which books 
that I complete here on this website. Though I also found it convenient
to use [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/104759146) to keep track of books as well. Giving complete reviews/reflections on these
books is not really my goal, but I might provide some aspect that I
found interesting or possibly a description of what was going on in
my life at the time I read the book.  

### The Path to War: How the First World War Created Modern America

Another book for the World War I class. Rather than being an account of the war and its 
battles, this class is more about the cultural shifts that happened to the involved countries. For example, the US going from a neutral power to sending millions overseas to fight on the
Western Front. Or additionally, how the countries had to change their industries to be able
to field such massive armies. 

### Rites of Spring: The Great War and the Birth of the Modern Age

One of the books I will be reading while studying World War I for a class. From the syllabus, this book is read interchangably with a couple others in a rotation, and I will not reach its
conclusion until the end of the semester. 

### Cosmos (January 7th - January 24th)

I made a lot of progress on this book the first two days I read it. 
Then I got poisioned by a Costco hot dog and lost my reading rhythm. 
School semester started so I started reading in the occasional freetime
I had, but this book really got finished while I was waiting in the
surgery pre-op room. As I was only getting my screws removed from my ankle,
more urgent surgeries got put ahead of me so I had to wait a couple
hours. Cosmos, written by Carl Sagan, is essentially the book version
of the famous TV show "Cosmos" also by Carl Sagan. At the time the book
was written, the Cold War was in it's last tense decade, and the depths
of the universe were being discovered through our telescopes and unmanned
spacecraft. Carl Sagan emphasizes that science should be popularized and
shared among the public, which is the reason for his efforts of
sharing the mysteries of the cosmos through the rising medium of
television. What Sagan covers is a vast array of topics, from the origins
of the universe, to the first practice of science in Ionian Greece, to the
distant future potential of humanity. Myself being interested in ancient
history since I was a kid, I really enjoyed any discussion about the
growth of science and exploration in the ancient world. The resourcefulness
of our ancestors from 2500 years ago I think is surprising to most people
and we often attribute a lot of discovery to the renaissance era. For
example, there were some who had already contemplated that one might
reach India by sailing west from Spain. Around this time as well, there
had already been explorers who had circumnavigated the entire continent
of Africa. The Mediteranean world and beyond was a bit more connected
than is commonly known, though this gap in public knowledge is likely
caused by the end of the ancient world begun by the fall of the Roman
Empire. 

### All the Shah's Men (January 5th - January 6th)

Picked this book up after the United States military killed Iranian 
general Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike. Writing about this subject
online is a hot take that I won't take a risk for. Old opinions tend
to resurface at inconvenient times. 

### Blueprint: The Evolutionary Origins of a Good Society (October 16th - January 3rd)

I actually started this book deep in 2019 but did not finish it until
winter break in 2020. For a better review, you can probably read the
one [Bill Gates](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Blueprint) wrote. This
book takes an evolutionary approach to how humans have evolved to be
cooperative and social.
