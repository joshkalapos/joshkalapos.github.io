My goal for 2021 is to read 50 books. At the time of writing this initial
description, I am two books behind my goal. 2021 marks beginning of the third year in
which I have started reading outside of education again. As usual, I report all the
books that I read using [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/104759146).
A differentiator from this year and last is that I expect to be reading more consistently,
rather than the sporadic reading sprees I had during college between tough periods
in the semester, or during breaks. As I presently work at Amazon Robotics, I have
plenty of free evenings relative to undergrad to spend reading. Though we'll
see how that changes once the weather becomes more suitable for me to spend time
outside, and covid either fades away or we treat it more as an endemic. Also as usual,
I wouldn't expect deep insights from anything I write, and I have yet to proofread
these.

# Can't Hurt Me (February 1st - February 3rd)

This book is actually not a common genre that I read, and I categorize it
under motivational memoirs. However, written by a former Navy Seal, Can't Hurt
Me was an excellent story from start to finish about freeing yourself from
mental limitations. A book I had read last year, Born to Run, had already
made me aware of the far reaches of human endurance that the majority of
us do not utilize in our daily lives. That book however confined that philosophy
mainly to running itself, as it was a book mostly about running. Can't Hurt Me
has a lot to do with running, as the author Groggins ends up as an ultra runner,
but he was able to apply the same philosphy of never quitting to nearly all
aspects of life. 

# A Promised Land (January 3rd - January 31st)

This book is one of the reasons I fell behind my goal of reading 50 books this
year. Though I hope to still be able to meet my goal (somewhat through cheating
by reading a few short books), Obama's memoir was long enough to throw a slight
wrench into my schedule. It was not until I returned to Boston that I set up
a schedule to actually complete this book. It is actually not a complicated read,
so spending enough time reading usually led to satisfying progress. Despite its
length, it actually only goes from Obama's birth, to around a year before the
2012 election. Obama's presidency from 2008 to 2016 were my formative years
from 5th grade to freshman year of college, so reliving those times through
his perspective felt especially interesting as it provided mored detail into
a world that I was only beginning to understand at that time.
