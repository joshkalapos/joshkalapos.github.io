In a weird turn of events I ended up having CMU Professor 
[David Kosbie](http://www.kosbie.net/cmu/) as my teacher for AP 
Computer Science. Quite the surprise from what was originally an 
ordinary class that prepared you for an AP exam in May. 

This class probably was what inspired me to pursue computer science and
specifically at Carnegie Mellon. Without it I would be studying
material science at Cornell (Quite a contrast) and living out my
days likely only knowing the basics of Python. 

That future will forever be unknown but here's the result of 
my work learning Java with Kosbie. My instinct is usually to create
a game when making a term project. So, with a single Java class (oh man)
and a lot of well named variables, I recreated Lunar Lander. The game
includes nice things like collision detection, randomly
generated, infinite maps, and gravity.
